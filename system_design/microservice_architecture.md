# Microservice Architecture

## Is the Microservice Architecture the Right Choice for Us?

Microservice architecture undoubtedly brings multiple advantages to the table, such as scalability, flexibility, and fault isolation. However, it's essential to remember that not all projects benefit equally from this system.

Here are key considerations that suggest we might need to think twice before jumping into the microservice architecture.

- Navigating Complexity: Adopting microservices could amplify the complexity of our system. Every service operates like a separate application, complete with its own database and programming language. This multi-layered structure could demand a higher degree of understanding from our developers, potentially complicating the development and testing processes.
- Managing Resources: Microservices operate independently, necessitating a unique runtime environment for each one. This characteristic could lead to a substantial surge in resource consumption, escalating our operational costs significantly.
- Team Expertise: Our development team's skill set is a crucial factor. Lack of familiarity with microservices might result in unforeseen challenges and design or implementation errors. The effort required to upskill our existing team or the cost of bringing new, experienced members onboard could be both time-consuming and expensive.

Given these factors, our guiding principle is, "Microservice architecture isn't our default choice, but we're open to it when absolutely necessary."

## Modular Monolith

Modular Monolith is a middle ground between the monolithic architecture and microservices architecture. A modular monolith is still a single application, but it's structured in a way that components are highly decoupled and organized around business capabilities, similar to microservices. The idea is to get most of the benefits of microservices, but without the operational complexity.

It is better to consider modular monolith as a stepping stone to microservices. If we are not sure whether microservices is the right choice for us, we can start with a modular monolith and then gradually break it down into microservices as we gain more experience and confidence.
